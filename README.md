# Customer Monitoring Application

## Description

The **Customer Monitoring Application** is a robust WPF-based application designed to manage and monitor users and their permissions. This application enables businesses to maintain user data, handle permissions efficiently, and interact with a SQL Server database using Entity Framework Core. With a focus on user experience, it provides a user-friendly interface for managing customer information and permissions, making it suitable for small to medium-sized businesses.

In addition to user management, this application integrates a **Telegram Bot** that enhances functionality by enabling users to interact with the application through Telegram, making it easier to manage tasks on the go.

### Features

- **User Management**: Create, read, update, and delete user profiles with ease.
- **Permission Management**: Assign, manage, and revoke permissions for users, ensuring appropriate access levels.
- **SQL Server Integration**: Leverages Entity Framework Core for seamless data access and manipulation.
- **WPF User Interface**: Offers a clean, modern interface designed for easy navigation and interaction.
- **Telegram Bot Integration**:
  - **Receive Excel Files**: Users can receive Excel files directly through the Telegram bot.
  - **Export Data**: Data can be exported to Excel with customizable configurations, allowing for tailored output formats.
  - **Special Configurations**: Users can specify particular settings for data export, such as file format, specific columns, and data filtering.

## Technologies Used

- **C# (.NET 6)**: The primary programming language and framework for developing the application.
- **WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)**: Used to build the application's user interface.
- **Entity Framework Core**: An ORM for accessing and managing data in the SQL Server database.
- **SQL Server**: The database management system used for data storage.
- **Dependency Injection**: Utilizes `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection` for managing application services.
- **Telegram Bot API**: For implementing the Telegram bot features.
